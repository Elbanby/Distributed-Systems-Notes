# Distributed Systems notes 

## About
In this Repo, I will be posting notes about distributed systems. I am self learning and currently exploring the topic.

So feel free to comment and correct me, would be highly appreciated! 

## Topics 

### Scalability

- Size scalability:  
adding more nodes should make the system linearly faster; growing the dataset should not increase latency

- Geographic scalability:  
it should be possible to use multiple data centers to reduce the time it takes to respond to user queries, while dealing with cross-data center latency in some sensible manner.

- Administrative scalability:  
adding more nodes should not increase the administrative costs of the system (e.g. the administrators-to-machines ratio).

#### Important aspects

- Performance (latency)
- availability
